 keep asking how to invest in crypto-economy step by step. What I need 
to know? How not to lose money? How to choose right cryptocurrency that 
will skyrocket?</p><p name="da13" id="da13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In
 this guide you will find exhaustive answers to many of those questions.
 But before I will explain you how to invest, I will better answer the 
question, why the hell do you need to invest your hard acquired money? I
 will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p><h3 name="6754" id="6754" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Invest because it is&nbsp;growing.</h3><p name="7529" id="7529" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There
 is such a thing. Over last 20 years with the invasion of the Internet, 
many people have earned amazing amounts of money on one simple thing as a
 Network Effect. What the hell is that? In 70-s there was one engineer 
Robert Metcalfe. He fully invented what we now call Ethernet. In order 
to make a profit on this invention, he was selling the network cards. At
 that time people did not understand why the computers need to connect 
to the network. Robert realized that it is necessary to find a 
reassuring argument that would prove that his network card is a panacea 
for all their illnesses. Robert said:</p><blockquote name="7f90" id="7f90" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The network’s value is proportional to the square of the number of users in this network.</blockquote><figure name="75d8" id="75d8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 343px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 68.60000000000001%;"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="1*-AsR-4RNT7TvEDN__SGQNA.jpeg" data-width="500" data-height="343" data-scroll="native"><img src="%20InvestingCrypto_files/1-AsR-4RNT7TvEDN__SGQNA.jpg" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="51"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-AsR-4RNT7TvEDN__SGQNA.jpeg" src="%20InvestingCrypto_files/1-AsR-4RNT7TvEDN__SGQNA_002.jpg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-AsR-4RNT7TvEDN__SGQNA.jpeg"></noscript></div></div></figure><p name="2a58" id="2a58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Well,
 you buy 10 computers without a network card and their conditional costs
 is equal to 10. But with network cards - conditional costs of 10 
computers will be 45! This is 4.5 times more profitable! 
“Wow” — corporate workers said and began to buy Robert’s network cards.</p><p name="be1d" id="be1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It
 turned out that Robert’s consideration is quite reasonable! You can use
 it for assessment of the Telecom companies which was rolled on a planet
 with redoubled force. The capitalisation of Telecom companies depends 
on the number of its users. And the dependence was not a straight line 
but a quadratic. At the dawn of the social networks, venture capitalists
 quickly remembered the cherished formula and applied it to such things 
as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. So the Metcalfe’s law has led to the 
fact that millions of Ethernet grids has evolved into what we now call 
the Internet.</p><p name="eeea" id="eeea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Simple
 truth — if the number of network users is steadily growing, the 
exponential growth of our investments is expected. Thus, Facebook was 
worth more than $ 300 billion. The formula is simple. Looking for a 
network which is growing steadily at the very beginning =&gt; put money 
=&gt; wait =&gt; profit! The question is — why Bitcoin? Because it’s the
 same network and it’s growing. Is growing quickly.

30% and even 50%.</p><p name="95ab" id="95ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It

is a stable source of income, start from 5%, and when you will be 
confident — raise the rate up to 40%. Think about your strategy: 5% for

 the source code for the wallet is opened. There must be a catch. The 
catch is that your bitcoins exist only as digital recording and this 
fact is accepted by all other users of Bitcoin network. For proving the 
right of ownership you can only provide a digital signature calculated 
using your unique private key. It turns out that this is the nature of 
digital ownership of new generation. We have to live in this digital

 Cyber.fund adjust the price and number of tokens in all significant 
blockchain systems. But the most important is cyber•Rating. The complete
 methodology is disclosed in this <a href="http://www.academia.edu/22691395/cyber_Rating_Crypto_Property_Evaluation" data-href="http://www.academia.edu/22691395/cyber_Rating_Crypto_Property_Evaluation" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">paper</a>.</p><h3 name="3ae3" id="3ae3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Transfer money to the&nbsp;exchange</h3><p name="5df2" id="5df2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Once
 you realised where to invest, you need to send bitcoins to the 
exchange, where the target asset is being traded&nbsp;. In our case it 
will be Poloniex. The truth is that Poloniex may disappear tomorrow and 
we will got a new meme in the Internet.</p><p name="6fbb" id="6fbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Therefore,
 you make these operations at your own risk. I estimate the probability 
of closing for each particular exchange during the year is 10%. In this 
series, and Coinbase and Poloniex and all sorts of banks like Xapo.</p><p name="4263" id="4263" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But
 now we use Poloniex because there are a lot of currencies and good 
liquidity. Decentralized trade is one of the most promising areas, but 
it is still at the very beginning. I think with the development of 
projects such as BitShares and BitSquare for one year or two years it 
will be a worthy alternative to Localbitcoins and Poloniex with good 
liquidity.</p><p name="eba8" id="eba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If Poloniex for some reason do not satisfy you, there are still a lot of other <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/" data-href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">exchanges</a>.

 comes the fun part. This step depends entirely on what you decided 
invest. Without this step, you will not be able to guarantee the 
long-term safety of your investments. I can say that on every official 
website of every blockchain system there are links to different wallets.
 Which trust or not to trust — it is your decision. I will list the 
tools that I use myself:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="bec4" id="bec4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases" data-href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mist</a>.

Over last 20 years with the invasion of the Internet, many people have earned amazing amounts of money on one simple thing as a Network Effect. What the hell is that? In 70-s there was one engineer Robert Metcalfe. He fully invented what we now call Ethernet. In order to make a profit on this invention, he was selling the network cards.
